### Objective of the projet at the start
The objective of this project is to develop a social network like facebook for UJM's students. At the start of the project the idea is to do the same functionalites of facebook, manage Groups, Actualities, events, use a chat .. 

At the end of this project we have develop lot's of this functionalies : 
  - Manage events, you can add an event like a party, conference, you can update it, join it, delete it when you are the owner
  - Consult actualities, you can add an actuality, update and delete it, all the peoples will watch it
  - You can create a group, add student in it for communciate, organise something
  - You have a chat to communicate between the students, send messages, delete

But we haven't got a complete social Network, we need to perform some point, like the group management. It will be fun to add actualities in a group, send email for group members when a actuality has been posted etc.. 
For the chat we can't watch if a person is connected like facebook, you can just send a message to a user with his addresse email.

It's impossible to develop a full social network in 2 months so we are very happy about our performance and developement. Some point can be ameliorate but it is actually a functionality application.


The difficulties in this project is for Kevin and Youssef to learn about React and Spring boot application, Julien already know this technologies so he helped their to learn this technologies. 
The dificulity for Julien is to understand the Authentication system of spring boot and adapt it to the facebook authentication, he spent lot's of this problem. 
At the end of the project Julien work on every parts of this projects, and kevin help him sometimes for templating part and Kevin develop the React part. 
Youssef help sometimes Julien on the controller, he did the delete function.
