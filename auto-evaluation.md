### “Good Development Practices”
In this project Julien decide to respect all the good development practises because it's important. We didn't do any test because we haven't got the time to do it, but if we had the time we can write unhit test. 
The java convention have been respected, the code is commented and we use pattern to delete the duplication. The architecture is very clear. 
On Github we do our commit in english, we din't work in pair programming. To perform this part of git, Julien propose to use branch for develop functionalities but the members of the group didn't want because they don't know how to use it. 

So to conclude at the end we are happy about our work, we respect the deadline, we do lot's of functionalites, the good practises are respected and we use github.


We don't have time to put it in online but julien have got a private dedicated server so he can run on it or we can use the solution about cloud, appengine (google) or heroku. Julien didn't have time to do it.
